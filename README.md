ofxCocoa
========

Memo Atken's ofxCocoa library fixed for openFrameworks 0072+. This is almost 100% the same as Memo's ofxCocoa 
addon in his amazing [msalibs](https://github.com/memo/msalibs) repository, just with a few minor fixes for the
newest versions of OF. I'll try to add more examples as they come up, but I wanted to get this in its own repo
for simplicity's sake.
